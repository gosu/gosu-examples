Gosu Examples
=============

This is a collection of Ruby example games for the [Gosu media library](https://libgosu.org/).

To run the examples, simply install the `gosu-examples` Ruby gem and then run `gosu-examples` in the terminal.

Some examples require the following libraries to be installed:

    gem install chipmunk
    gem install rmagick
    gem install opengl

(This is a very rough first version of this gem. Feel free to contribute to all parts of this repository via Pull Requests - media files, more examples, cleaning up code... - as long as we can use your contributions under the MIT license.)
